# nlpregex READEME UNDER DEVELOPMENT SOON TO BE READY
Regular Language Representation Converter, Visualizer, and Decoder &amp; Acceptor

<a href="docs/banner.png"> <img src="docs/banner.png"></a>


# Description
Nlpregex is a set of python tools and components to visualize and convert representation of regular language.
It is aimed at speech recognition and natural language processing, 
and the alphabets (Î£) are not characters, but tokenized terminals.
The conversion of the representations forms a closed ecosystem among the following

* Regular Expression (RE)
* Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
* Nondeterministic Finite-state Automaton (NFA) 
* Deterministic Finite-state Automaton (DFA)
* Flat list of phrases (provided the language does not contain infinite repetitions.)

The regular expression is augumented to include the output attributes after a terminal, and
before and after a group enclosed by '(' and ')' in paires.
The attributes are transferred to the output tokens of FA and it is used for the decoder as FST.

# Conversion from FA to AST
The technical contribution of this project is the conversion from FA to AST, which makes it possible
to convert a flat list of phrases to a regular expression.
The visualization of AST, NFA, and DFA are done by GraphViz.
